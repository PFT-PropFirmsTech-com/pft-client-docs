### 🚧 v1.3 CRM Partner Tracking (S2S Postbacks)

**Milestone Goal:** A Trading Cult affiliate partner can attribute registrations and conversions to their own traffic — a partner `clickid` is captured at landing, persisted through signup and purchase, and fires S2S GET postbacks (with clickid + goal + payout) on registration and first sale (FTD only). Backend-heavy (pft-backend) + small pft-dashboard cookie-capture piece. Source ticket: cmqt52jdb001dny0kknkou9x0.

**Hidden prerequisites made explicit:**
- `TrackingEvents.signupCompleted()` and `.purchaseCompleted()` are defined but have ZERO callers today — Phase 11 must wire both as new call sites.
- The existing `conversionWebhook` adapter is NOT reusable (wrong event map + POST/JSON/HMAC vs required GET/macro) — Phase 12 builds a new `partnerPostback` adapter.

#### Phase 10: Capture & Persist

**Goal:** The partner `clickid` is captured at the tracking-link entry point, survives in a first-party cookie to the registration form, and is persisted durably on both the User document and the Payment document — so every downstream event emitter can resolve it even from a gateway webhook callback where no browser request exists.

**Depends on:** Nothing (first v1.3 phase; builds on existing User/Payment schema patterns)

**Requirements:** CRM-01, CRM-02, CRM-03

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE when Phase 10 completes):
1. A GET request to `/track?clickid=ABC123` sets a `_partner_clickid` first-party cookie and redirects to the site; the clickid value is unchanged in the cookie.
2. A user who registers after visiting a tracking link has `partnerClickId: "ABC123"` stored on their User document in the DB (verified via the post-registration user record).
3. A payment created by that user has `partnerClickId: "ABC123"` stored on the Payment document (verified at checkout-creation time, before any gateway callback fires).
4. A user who registers without a tracking link has no `partnerClickId` field on their User document (skip-when-absent behavior confirmed).

**Plans:** 4 plans (3 autonomous code plans in Wave 1 + 1 deferred live-verify checkpoint in Wave 2)

Plans:
- [x] 10-01: `GET /track` route + `_partner_clickid` cookie (backend `09ca7387`) + pft-dashboard cookie-read + forward as `partnerClickId` in signup body (`e111dab1`) (CRM-01) — [wave 1] ✓
- [x] 10-02: `partnerClickId` on User interface + indexed schema field; persists via existing registration payload spread, survives OTP round-trip — no auth.service.ts edit (backend `d2992553`) (CRM-02) — [wave 1] ✓
- [x] 10-03: `partnerClickId` on Payment `attribution` interface+schema; persist from authoritative `user.partnerClickId` at standard checkout AND PAP funded-leg creation (backend `4a079169`) (CRM-03) — [wave 1] ✓
- [ ] 10-04: DEFERRED post-deploy live human-verify of the full capture→persist path (CRM-01/02/03) — [wave 2, gated on next main-2026 deploy]

Note: partner-facing tracking URL is `/api/tracking/track?clickid=…` (mounted under existing tracking router). A prettier `/track` requires a brand-landing infra rewrite — config/verify detail, not code.

#### Phase 11: Wire Emits + Dedup

**Goal:** The two tracking helpers that have zero callers today (`TrackingEvents.signupCompleted()` and `.purchaseCompleted()`) are wired at their real call sites — registration completion and all payment-completion paths including the currently-unwired PAP path — threading `partnerClickId` + `usdAmount` + `currency=USD` through each; a FTD (first-purchase) guard prevents repeat conversion fires; and a dual-dispatch audit ensures the existing legacy `ConversionWebhookEventsService` path cannot double-fire the same event.

**Depends on:** Phase 10 (partnerClickId must be on User + Payment docs before emit sites can read it)

**Requirements:** CRM-04, CRM-05, CRM-06, CRM-08

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE when Phase 11 completes):
1. After a user completes OTP registration, the `signup_completed` tracking event fires exactly once (verified via `TrackingEventLog`); a second OTP submission for the same user does not produce a second log entry.
2. After a user's first completed payment (standard challenge or PAP funded-leg), the `purchase_completed` tracking event fires exactly once carrying `partnerClickId`, `usdAmount`, and `currency: "USD"`.
3. A second completed payment by the same user does NOT produce a second `purchase_completed` tracking event (FTD guard confirmed).
4. The PAP funded-leg payment-completion path (`pap_payment_completed`) emits the purchase event — confirmed by a `TrackingEventLog` entry for a PAP payment.
5. A dual-dispatch audit of `ConversionWebhookEventsService` call sites confirms no event that now fires via the Tracking path can also double-fire via the legacy direct path.

**Plans:** TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 11-01: Wire `TrackingEvents.signupCompleted()` at registration callsite + `partnerClickId` on `ITrackingEventPayload` (CRM-04)
- [ ] 11-02: `trackingPurchaseEmit` utility + wire at all paid-completion paths incl. PAP (CRM-05, CRM-06) + FTD guard
- [ ] 11-03: Dual-dispatch audit — confirm `ConversionWebhookEventsService` call sites do not overlap new Tracking path (CRM-08) + `TrackingEventLog` dedup verification

#### Phase 12: partnerPostback Adapter + Config + Verify

**Goal:** A new `partnerPostback` GET adapter fires to the partner's configured URL template with `{clickid}` / `goal` / `{payout}` macro substitution (URL-encoded), fire-and-forget with timeout and a delivery-log record; the per-brand `TrackingSettings.destinations.partnerPostback` config for Trading Cult stores the registration + conversion URL templates with an enable toggle; no other brand fires postbacks unless configured.

**Depends on:** Phase 11 (emit events must fire before the adapter can receive them)

**Requirements:** CRM-07, CRM-09

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE when Phase 12 completes):
1. A `destinations/partner-postback.ts` adapter exists, implements `IDestinationAdapter`, and is registered in `destinations/index.ts`; it returns `status: "skipped"` when `partnerClickId` is absent or the URL template is empty.
2. When a `signup_completed` event fires for a user with a `partnerClickId`, the adapter issues a GET request to the configured registration URL template with `{clickid}` URL-encoded in the query string and `goal=registration`; a delivery-log record is written.
3. When a `purchase_completed` event fires for a user with a `partnerClickId`, the adapter issues a GET request to the configured conversion URL template with `{clickid}` URL-encoded, `goal=conversion`, and `payout=<usdAmount>` + `currency=USD`; a delivery-log record is written.
4. A `partnerClickId` value containing URL-special characters (e.g. `+`, `=`, `/`) is correctly `encodeURIComponent`-ed before substitution — the partner receives the exact original value.
5. [POST-DEPLOY CHECKPOINT — deferred] Trading Cult live traffic: a test registration via a partner tracking link produces a delivery-log entry with `status: "sent"` and the partner's tracking system shows the registration event.

**Plans:** TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 12-01: `TrackingSettings.destinations.partnerPostback` config shape + model + interface (CRM-09) + Trading Cult DB seed
- [ ] 12-02: `destinations/partner-postback.ts` adapter — GET fetch, `expandMacros()`, `encodeURIComponent`, skip guards, delivery log, fire-and-forget wrapper (CRM-07)
- [ ] 12-03: Register adapter + end-to-end integration verify (registration postback + conversion postback + URL-special-char clickid test)
